\title{Progressively search for facilities (roads, schools, healthcare)}
\usage{
search_facilities_progressive(
  center_point,
  bbox,
  facility_type,
  friction_extent = NULL,
  tr_corrected = NULL,
  raster_crs = NULL,
  max_search_multiplier = 20,
  search_increment = 2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{center_point}{An \code{sf} point (WGS84) representing the community center.}

\item{bbox}{Numeric vector defining the initial bounding box (\code{c(left, bottom, right, top)}).}

\item{facility_type}{Character string; one of \code{"paved_road"}, \code{"healthcare"}, or \code{"school"}.}

\item{friction_extent}{Optional \code{raster::extent} defining the spatial coverage of the friction raster.}

\item{tr_corrected}{Optional \code{gdistance} TransitionLayer (geo-corrected) for travel time computation.}

\item{raster_crs}{CRS of the friction raster.}

\item{max_search_multiplier}{Integer; maximum expansion factor for the bounding box (default = 20).}

\item{search_increment}{Integer; amount to increase the expansion multiplier in each iteration (default = 2).}
}
\value{
Numeric; minimum walking travel time (in minutes) from the community center to the nearest facility, or \code{NA}
if no facilities are found within the expanded area.
}
\description{
Expands the bounding box around a community incrementally until at least one facility of the specified type
is found in OpenStreetMap data. Optionally computes travel time to the nearest facility using a friction surface.
