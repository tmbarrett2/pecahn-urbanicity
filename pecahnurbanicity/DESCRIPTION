Description: Tools for computing geospatial and infrastructural measures of 
    urbanicity using OpenStreetMap and raster datasets. Supports multi-year 
    analysis of population density (WorldPop) and nighttime light intensity 
    (VIIRS/Earth Observation Group) to track urbanization trends over time. 
    Developed for the Population Ecology, Aging, and Health Network (PEcAHN).
